The issue is resolved by explicitly checking for the `false` return value of `strpos()` without relying on loose type comparison.
```php
<?php
$haystack = "This is a test string";
$needle = "This";

if (strpos($haystack, $needle) === false) {
    echo "Needle not found";
} else {
    echo "Needle found at position " . strpos($haystack, $needle);
}

$needle2 = "test2";
if (strpos($haystack, $needle2) === false) {
    echo "\nNeedle2 not found";
} else {
    echo "\nNeedle2 found at position " . strpos($haystack, $needle2);
}
?>
```
This version correctly identifies whether the needle is present, regardless of its position in the haystack.
