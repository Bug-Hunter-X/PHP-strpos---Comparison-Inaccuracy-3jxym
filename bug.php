This code suffers from a subtle issue related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison.  The `strpos()` function returns `false` if the needle is not found, and `0` if it's found at the beginning of the haystack. Since `0` is considered falsy in PHP, the comparison `strpos($haystack, $needle) === false` will incorrectly evaluate to true if the needle is at the beginning of the haystack. This leads to unintended behavior and potentially incorrect results.
